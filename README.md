# terraform_infra!
These are terraform config files using Data source to use the resource group already created. 
Compared to the import command, the resource will not be managed by terraform and won't be included in terraform state. Therefore, the terraform destroy command will not delete the resource.
Here is the infrastructure deployed by those files.
You can find details in the tfstate file.
